            Marking a significant step toward enhancing the resilience and competitiveness of Ukrainian enterprises,
            the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) organized a series of raising
            awareness activities and facilitated an expert group meeting aimed at equipping these enterprises with
            sustainable practices critical to their economic recovery and long-term progress. By aligning with
            international environmental and social standards, Ukrainian enterprises are now better positioned to
            participate and thrive in demanding global markets, boosting Ukraine’s broader economic stability in
            these challenging times.

            into the operations of Ukrainian exporters. Key focus areas included enhancing competitiveness through
            sustainability in alignment with the European Green Deal and the Sustainable Development Goals.

            The series of workshops concluded with a dedicated expert group meeting that brought together experts
            sharing key insights and strategies, reflecting the commitment of Ukrainian export-oriented SMEs to
            achieving sustainable development and enhancing their global market presence.

            Participants gained useful insights into how to effectively integrate Environmental, Social and
            Governance (ESG) principles into their corporate plans. By incorporating ESG standards into all business
            processes, they improved their strategic planning and risk management capabilities. The workshops gave
            participants practical tools for market analysis, allowing them to find new markets, analyse product
            requirements, and develop focused entry strategies. They also gained skills in assessing their companies&#39;
            readiness for export by examining internal resources and adapting to varied regulatory requirements.
